The official code implementation of SYNGRAID from our paper:

SYNGRAID: A Retrosynthetic AI Model for Small Molecule Detection Using a Biomedical Knowledge Graph Integrating Diseases, Drugs, and Genes

## Model Description
The SYNGRAID model (Synthesis Graph-based Retrosynthetic AI Designer) is a novel architecture designed to predict relevant small molecules (e.g., drugs) by leveraging a heterogeneous biomedical knowledge graph that integrates diseases, drugs, and genes.

## The model combines:

Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for node-type-specific embeddings,

Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for relation weighting, and

XGBoost for the final classification of molecular associations.

This approach enables precise detection of candidate small molecules associated with diseases through a deep understanding of geneâ€“diseaseâ€“drug interactions.

##  Architecture Steps
Step 1: Knowledge graph construction from tripartite relationships (disease-drug, gene-disease, gene-drug)
Step 2: Node-type-specific embedding with GNN modules
Step 3: Graph attention fusion to highlight biologically relevant interactions
Step 4: Classification via XGBoost to detect drugâ€“disease associations
 Final output: Probability scores indicating how likely a drug (small molecule) is to be therapeutically associated with a disease.
